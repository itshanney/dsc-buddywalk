                        What better way is there to celebrate the 20th year of the Puget Sound Buddy Walk than to hear from two young people who have participated in the Buddy Walk for years?

                        <strong>Phillip Thelin</strong>, whose bagpipes have led the walk for many years, learned the art of piping from his grandfather, Bill Ross, who was the Walk's first piper, and then took over that role as a teen. Phillip is now employed in his dream job in Food Prep at Microsoft and will share his story with us.
