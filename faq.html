        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
        <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>

        <p class="bw">
        The walk is free to everyone. The walk is made possible by the Down Syndrome Community, businesses in the community, and generous individuals.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I just make a donation?</h3>

        <p>
        The fastest and easiest way to donate is ONLINE. Simply click the “Donate” button from the home page and follow the instructions. You can also send a check to:
        Down Syndrome Community
        Attn: Puget Sound Buddy Walk ®2014
        17930 Normandy Terrace SW
        Normandy Park, WA 98166
        </p>

        <h3>Why should I register on line instead of at the event?</h3>

        <p>
        Registering online before the day of event helps you and helps us. If you register by September 10th - you will receive the size of t-shirt(s) you asked for as the t-shirt order will be placed after this date. Registering before the day of event gives you an opportunity to utilize the tools we have provided to help spread the word of the event, maybe 'build a team' if you'd like, and maybe do some fundraising.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I register myself and my family?</h3>

        <p>
        I only see "Join a Team" or "Create a Team". If you do not wish to join an existing team or create a team, simply choose "None. I'm registering as an individual" from the "Join a Team" drop down menu. On the next screen, continue with registering yourself and any others you are registering. 
        </p>

        <h3>Is there a place for me to tell you who else I am registering?</h3>

        <p>
        No. The software records only the number of people you are registering, not their individual names and/or contact information. If someone wants to have their name listed, they will need to register separately. They can, however, join your team (if you create one) and/or they can link to your team fundraising page. The registration form does have a place for you to enter the number of people you are registering.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need to be a part of a team or create a team? </h3>

        <p>
        No. Everyone is welcome! If you do not wish to join an existing team or create a team, simply choose "None. I'm registering as an individual" from the "Join a Team" drop down menu. 
        </p>

        <p>
        However, if you would like to create a team, follow the links on the website to create your very own Personal Page. We have provided a Team Captain/Fundraiser Tips section. For help on setting up a Personal and/or Team Page, refer to the Help with Personal and Team Pages on the menu bar.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I register for the Puget Sound Buddy Walk and not do any fundraising? </h3>

        <p>
        Yes, this is a free event and everyone is welcome. The registration process will automatically create a personal fundraising page for each person completing the registration process. However, you are not required to utilize the page. You will have the option to “ Hide My Individual Page” which will keep the page from becoming 'active' or available. Fundraising is optional but appreciated.
        </p>

        <h3>Who gets a free t-shirt? </h3>

        <p>
        All persons with Down syndrome will get a free t-shirt. In order to be sure to get the size needed, registration must be completed by September 10th. From September 11th-24th, you can state the requested size, however we cannot ensure we will have the size available. After September 24th, availability of t-shirts and specific sizes will be on a first come-first served basis. 
        </p>

        <h3>Why can't I get the size t-shirt I need after September 10th? </h3>

        <p>
        We will be ordering the t-shirts on September 11th based on the orders (via pre-registration) we have received. Additional t-shirts in a variety of sizes will be ordered in an attempt to be able to fill additional pre-registration orders (submitted between September 11th and 24th) and still have t-shirts available for those who register after September 24th(including the day of the event). Since we will be "guessing" at that point, all orders after September 10th will be based on the 'additional' t-shirts that are ordered and will be filled on a first come-first served basis.
        </p>

        <h3>Will t-shirts be available the day of the event? </h3>

        <p>
        Our goal is to order enough t-shirts to fill pre-registration orders and have t-shirts available the day of the event. Sizes maybe limited the for those who register after September 24th(including the day of the event).
        </p>

        <h3>How do I create a Personal Page or Team Page?</h3>

        <p>
        If you have already registered for the Buddy Walk®, a Personal Page was automatically created when you registered and you were sent an email with a link to your Personal Page, your Username, and password. Log into your account and begin ‘personalizing’ your Personal Page. See the Help with Personal and Team Pages on the menu bar.
        </p>

        <p>
        If at the time of registration you checked the checkbox next to “Hide My Personal Page”, you will need to be sure to ‘activate’ your Personal or Team Page so that it becomes available to others on the web. From your email click on the link to your personal webpage, Log in, go to the Design/Edit menu on the left hand tool bar, click on Your Account Status, and click the Activate button at the top of your edit screen.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you have not already registered for the Buddy Walk®, you will have to create an account and register for the Buddy Walk®. If you don’t plan on attending, just register as if you were attending with 1 person in your party. Unfortunately, the software is currently limited to setting up Personal and/or Team Pages for those who create an account and part of the setting up the account involves ‘registering’ at least 1 person. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Once you have completed the registration process, you will receive an email with a link to your Personal and/or Team Page along with your Username and password. See the Help with Personal and Team Pages on the menu bar.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I create a Personal Fundraising Page even if I won't be at the event?</h3>

        <p>
        Yes. Go through the registration process. Once you have completed the registration process, you will receive an email with a link to your Personal and/or Team Page along with your Username and password. See the Help with Personal and Team Pages on the menu bar.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I sponsor a Walker or Team?</h3>

        <p>
        If you have received a link to the individual's Personal Page or to a Team’s Team Page, simply click on the link and then click the DONATE button.
        </p>

        <p>
        You can search for any individual or team that has registered for the Buddy Walk® using the Search function at the top of the Home page.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you cannot find who you are looking for, you can always make a general donation and indicate who you want the donation to be attributed to. Click on the Donate button found at the bottom of the Home page to begin the process.
        </p>

        <h3>How can my friends and family find my personal or Team page?</h3>

        <p>
        Send them the link to your page in an email, via Facebook, or via Twitter.
        They can also use the Search function at the top of the Home page.
        </p>

        <h3>How will I know if anyone has donated on my page? </h3>

        <p>
        The default setting when your Personal Page was created during registration is set to have an email sent to you each time someone donates to you or your team and each time someone joins your team. You do have the option to turn this function off. You can also go into your page and get a summary of all donations made to your page. See the Help with Personal and Team Pages on the menu bar.
        </p>

        <h3>What do I do if I can’t remember my Username or Password?</h3>

        <p>
        No problem. Simply go to http://dsc.donorpages.com/BuddyWalk2015/login. This takes you to the login screen. Click on "Forgot Username/Password". Also, your Username and Password were sent to the email address you provided when you registered.
