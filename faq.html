        </p>

        <h3>If I don't want to walk, can I just make a donation?</h3>
        <p>
        The fastest and easiest way to donate is ONLINE. Simply click the <strong>Donate</strong> button from the home page and follow the instructions. You can also send a check to:
        </p>

        Down Syndrome Community<br/>
        Attn: Puget Sound Buddy Walk&reg; 2015<br/>
        17930 Normandy Terrace SW<br/>

        </p>

        <h3>How long is the walk?</h3>
        <p>
        The walk is a short stroll around Seattle Center, starting at Next 50 Plaza and circling around the International Fountain.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I register?</h3>
        <p>
        Registering online is preferred. Online registration will be open until October 3rd and registration will also be accepted on site the day of the walk.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I order t-shirts?</h3>
        <p>
        Those who register online by September 4th can order a walk t-shirt for $10 each, with a free t-shirt for individuals with Down syndrome. There will be a limited number of t-shirts available for purchase at the registration table the day of the walk if you miss the pre-order deadline. So if you want to guarantee a t-shirt you'll need to register early!
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need to fundraise?</h3>
        <p>
        Fundraising is optional but greatly appreciated! Donations can be made in honor of someone or just to support the DSC. Donations are tax deductible. All walk proceeds will help the DSC to foster acceptance and inclusion in the Puget Sound area.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I register more than one person?</h3>
        <p>
        Yes, you can register up to 10 people at one time, including yourself.  The software records only the number of people you are registering, not their individual names and/or contact information. If someone wants to have their name listed, they will need to register separately.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need to be a part of a team or create a team?</h3> 
        <p>No. Everyone is welcome! If you do not wish to join an existing team or create a team, simply choose "None. I'm registering as an individual" from the "Join a Team" drop down menu. 
        </p>

        <h3>Will t-shirts be available the day of the event?</h3> 
        <p>
        There will be a limited number of t-shirts available for purchase at the registration table the day of the walk if you miss the pre-order deadline. So if you want to guarantee a t-shirt you'll need to register early!

        <a name="pages"><h2>Fundraising Pages</h2></a>
        <h3>How do I create a team page?</h3>  
        <p>
        If you would like to create a team, follow the links on the website to register. The Registration Help link at the top of the page can walk you through it. If you elect to Create a Team, two different pages will be created - one as an individual and one for your team (you'll share the team link). Personalize your team page, create your own message and share it with friends, family & others. Have fun!
        </p>

        <h3>How do I create a personal Page?</h3>
        <p>
        A personal page is automatically created when you register.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I create a Personal Fundraising Page even if I won't be at the event?</h3>
        <p>
        Yes. A Personal Page is automatically created when you register. Personalize your page, create your own message, use the tools on the site to share it with friends, family & others.  Have fun!  And thank you!
        </p>

        <h3>How can I sponsor a Walker or Team?</h3>
        <p>
        You can search for any individual or team on the Leaderboard page.  If you have received a link to the individual's Personal Page or Team Page, simply click on the link and then click the Donate button.
        </p>
        <p>
        OR make a general donation and indicate who you want the donation to be attributed to. Click on the Donate button on the home page.
        </p>

        <h3>How can my friends and family find my personal or Team page?</h3>
        <p>
        Send them the link to your page in an email, via Facebook, or via Twitter. They can also use the Search function on the Leaderboard page.
        </p>

        <h3>How will I know if anyone has donated on my page?</h3>
        <p>
        The default setting when your Personal Page was created during registration is set to have an email sent to you each time someone donates to you or your team and each time someone joins your team. You do have the option to turn this function off. You can also go into your page and get a summary of all donations made to your page. 
        </p>

        <h3>What do I do if I can't remember my Username or Password?</h3>
        <p>
        No problem. Simply go to <a href="http://dsc.donorpages.com/BuddyWalk2015/login" target="_blank">http://dsc.donorpages.com/BuddyWalk2015/login</a>. This takes you to the login screen.
