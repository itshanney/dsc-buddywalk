        When you register for the Buddy Walk&reg;, you will be prompted with several screens depicting the 
        entire process. Below are screenshots that walk through the process along with an explanation of the
        steps involved.

        The first step of the process is to collect information about the registrant. You will supply your
        <strong>first name</strong> and <strong>last name</strong> along with your <strong>email address</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Fundraising for the Buddy Walk&reg; is accomplished through Team pages, which you will share with friends
        and family to help raise money. As part of the registration process an individual page is created with a Team page. Check the <strong>Hide My Individual Page</strong> to make the individual page hidden. You will want to 
        share the Team page link with friends once complete.

        Next you will indicate the number of participants you wish to register for the Buddy Walk&reg;, including yourself. Every individual who has Down syndrome will receive a free t-shirt for the event. Use the next section to indicate the desired shirt sizes. Finally, those who wish to purchase a t-shirt for the event can do so for $10 per shirt. The final section of the form allows you to pick the sizes of those shirts that are being purchased.

        The final page asks for the information of the person representing the Team during registration. This person will be the primary contact for the Team as well as the person who will receive the registration bundle on the day of the walk.
