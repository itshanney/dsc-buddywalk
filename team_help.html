Team Captain / Fundraiser Tips

Fundraising is easy! Here are some tips to help you get started:

Set your goal: Set your fundraising goal when you edit your personal fundraising page. Don't be shy. Keep on asking even after you reach your goal. 

Personalize your Personal and Team pages: We've provided you with a 'starting' point. Use some, all, or none of what has been provided. You can create your own awesome team page - change the introduction text, add a photo, and add a personal story. Be creative! If you are a Team Captain – you have both your personal page AND your team page. Make it compelling. These are the pages that potential team members and donors will be visiting! 

Start with yourself: Get the ball rolling by making the first donation to your fundraising page. Register other Team members or invite others to join. When they register, they can choose to ‘Join a Team” and select your team from the drop down menu or they can join right from your Team page or Personal Page.

Share your page on social media: Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have made it easier than ever to share information. Be creative with your posts and always include the link to your Team/Fundraising page. You can share on social media directly from your Team Fundraising page. 

Ask Early: The earlier you begin asking people to support your fundraising efforts, the more you will raise. Once your personal and/or team fundraising page has been set up, you can send emails to your friends and family through your Fundraising Page. The emails will provide a direct link to your personal page where your friends and family can join your team and/or make a donation on your behalf. We’ve even written some sample emails to help get you started.

Say thank you: Track your donations. Whether they are joining you on the walk or making a donation, send them a thank you note and tell them how much you appreciate their support. You can send thank you notes from your personal page.
