<p class="bw">The Buddy Walk brings together family, friends, professionals and community leaders from across Puget Sound for a day of celebration to promote awareness and acceptance of individuals with Down syndrome. It is hosted by the Down Syndrome Community (DSC), a local non-profit organization committed to building a loving, supportive community for all those touched by Down syndrome. The Buddy Walk is the DSC’s largest fundraiser of the year and a vital source of support for its ongoing efforts to improve the lives of individuals with Down syndrome, and their families, through community outreach, events, support groups, public education and advocacy.
