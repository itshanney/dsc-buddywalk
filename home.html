                    The Buddy WalkÂ® was developed by the National Down Syndrome Society in 1995 to celebrate Down Syndrome Awareness Month in October and to promote acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome. The Buddy Walk&reg; has grown from 17 walks in 1995 to nearly 300 Walks planned for 2015 worldwide. In 2014, nearly $13 million was raised nationwide to benefit local programs and services, as well as the national advocacy and public awareness initiatives of NDSS that benefit all individuals with Down syndrome.
